# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

This Power BI project aims to provide insights into the sales data of an e-commerce business. The dashboard visualizes various aspects of the sales which help stakeholders understand sales performance, trends, and customer behavior.

## Overview

The e-commerce sales dashboard consists of several interactive reports and visualizations covering different aspects of the sales data. These include:

- **Sales Overview**: A high-level summary of sales performance, including total revenue, number of orders, and average order value over time.
- **Product Performance**: Insights into the performance of individual products, including sales volume, revenue contribution, and top-selling products.
- **Customer Analysis**: Understanding customer behavior and demographics, including customer acquisition trends, repeat purchase rate, and customer segmentation.
- **Sales by Region**: Visualizing sales performance across different regions or geographic areas, helping identify opportunities and trends in specific markets.

## Data Sources

The dashboard is built using data extracted from the e-commerce database of the perosn name "Madhav", which typically includes transactional data such as orders, products, customers, and sales transactions. The csv file of order and details are extracted, transformed, and loaded  into Power BI.
